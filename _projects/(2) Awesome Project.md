description: Research for my senior honors thesis regarding the idea of a contract curse within the NHL. Focuses on the questions: Do contracts affect player performance and stability? Is there evidence of shirking after signing an extended, multi-year, guaranteed contract?

# Contract Curse in Sports

The contract curse is the idea that during contract years, players would perform at a higher rate to ensure a bigger contract, and then slack off once theyâ€™ve signed one. Whether or not this is true was one of the motivating factors for this research; evidence of shirking behavior would mean a new approach to contracts (length and salary) may be necessary.
